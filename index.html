    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Dante Alighieri's "Inferno" is the first part of his epic poem "Divine Comedy," one of the greatest literary works in Western literature. Written in the early 14th century, the poem details the journey of Dante through Hell, guided by the Roman poet Virgil. "Inferno" is more than just a depiction of suffering and punishment; it is a rich allegory about the consequences of sin and the moral choices that define a person's fate.</p>
    <p>The work begins when Dante, lost in a dark forest, is confronted by three beasts that prevent him from finding his way out. He is then guided by Virgil, who represents reason and wisdom. Together, they descend into Hell, a place where the damned are eternally punished for the sins they committed during their lives. Each of the nine circles of Hell corresponds to a different sin, with increasingly severe punishments as they descend deeper into the abyss. The journey through Hell is symbolic of the soul's struggle with sin and its potential for redemption.</p>
    <p>Throughout "Inferno," Dante encounters various figures from history, mythology, and the Bible, many of whom embody the sins for which they are being punished. Each encounter serves as a moral lesson, illustrating the consequences of deviating from righteousness and the importance of repentance. The journey is not just one of punishment, but also of self-reflection, enlightenment, and the pursuit of moral clarity.</p>

    <h2>Stages of Hell</h2>
    <p>"Inferno" is structured around the concept of nine circles of Hell, each representing a different type of sin. These circles are arranged in a descending order, with the most serious sins being punished in the deepest circles. The circles are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>First Circle - Limbo:</strong> The sin of unbaptized souls and virtuous pagans. Their punishment is not one of torment but an eternal longing for the divine that they can never attain.

        </li>
        <li><strong>Second Circle - Lust:</strong> The souls of the lustful are blown about by an eternal storm, symbolizing their inability to control their desires during their lives.

        </li>
        <li><strong>Third Circle - Gluttony:</strong> The gluttonous are forced to lie in a filthy, freezing rain, representing the degradation of indulging in excess.

        </li>
        <li><strong>Fourth Circle - Greed:</strong> The greedy souls push heavy weights in a pointless, eternal struggle, reflecting their obsession with material wealth in life.

        </li>
        <li><strong>Fifth Circle - Wrath:</strong> The wrathful are trapped in a river of boiling blood, constantly fighting and lashing out at one another in their eternal rage.

        </li>
        <li><strong>Sixth Circle - Heresy:</strong> The heretics are confined to flaming tombs, their punishment reflecting their rejection of divine truth.

        </li>
        <li><strong>Seventh Circle - Violence:</strong> This circle is divided into three rings, each punishing different forms of violence: against others, oneself (suicides), and God or nature.

        </li>
        <li><strong>Eighth Circle - Fraud:</strong> The fraudulent are punished in various ways, such as being trapped in a pit of excrement or bound to a rock while being eaten by serpents.
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d4/Stradano_Inferno_Canto_20.jpg/220px-Stradano_Inferno_Canto_20.jpg" alt="Fraud">
        </li>
        <li><strong>Ninth Circle - Treachery:</strong> The deepest and most severe punishment is reserved for traitors, who are frozen in a lake of ice, their bodies utterly immobilized.

        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Each circle represents a different moral failing, and the punishment reflects the nature of the sin committed. The deeper one descends into Hell, the more severe and permanent the punishment becomes, symbolizing the increasing gravity of the sins being punished.</p>

<section id="characters">
    <h2>Characters</h2>
    <p>The main characters in "Inferno" are Dante, the narrator and protagonist, and his guide, Virgil. Dante represents the human soul on a journey of self-awareness and redemption, while Virgil symbolizes human reason and wisdom, leading Dante through the dangers of Hell.</p>
    <p>In addition to Dante and Virgil, "Inferno" features numerous other characters, many of whom are historical or mythological figures. Some of these characters are famous poets, philosophers, or religious figures from Dante's own time or earlier periods. Here are six key characters from Dante's "Inferno":</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Character 1: Francesca da Rimini</strong><br>
            Francesca is a woman from the 13th century who is condemned to the second circle of Hell for committing adultery with her husband's brother, Paolo. Her tragic love story reflects the sin of lust. She and Paolo are swept in an eternal whirlwind, unable to control their passions. Francesca speaks of how her love for Paolo began innocently through reading romantic stories, but led to their downfall when they succumbed to their desires.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Character 2: Count Ugolino</strong><br>
            Count Ugolino is a traitor who is punished in the ninth circle of Hell. He is trapped in a block of ice and forced to gnaw on the head of Archbishop Ruggieri, the man who betrayed him. Ugolino’s story is one of political betrayal, but it takes on an even darker tone when it is revealed that he ate the bodies of his own children to survive during his imprisonment. His punishment is a reflection of his treacherous and gluttonous nature.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Character 3: Virgil</strong><br>
            Virgil, the Roman poet, is Dante’s guide through Hell. He represents human reason and wisdom, leading Dante through the nine circles of Hell with calm and logic. Although Virgil is virtuous, he is a pagan and cannot enter Heaven, which is why he can only guide Dante through Hell and Purgatory but not to the ultimate goal of salvation.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Character 4: Pope Boniface VIII</strong><br>
            Pope Boniface VIII is one of the most notorious figures in Dante’s "Inferno." He is found in the eighth circle, reserved for those who have committed fraud. Dante condemns Boniface for his political corruption and greed. The Pope’s role in the exploitation of the Church is shown as a betrayal of his sacred position, making him one of the most reviled figures in the poem.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Character 5: Dante the Pilgrim</strong><br>
            Dante the Pilgrim is the protagonist of the "Divine Comedy." Throughout his journey, he serves as both the author and the character who learns and grows from his experiences in Hell. His personal struggle represents the universal human condition, where the quest for spiritual redemption requires an understanding of sin and the consequences of one’s actions.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Character 6: Judas Iscariot</strong><br>
            Judas Iscariot, the infamous traitor who betrayed Jesus Christ, is placed in the deepest part of Hell, the ninth circle. He is eternally frozen in a lake of ice, chewing on the head of Satan himself. His punishment symbolizes the ultimate act of treachery. In the "Inferno," Dante places Judas among the worst sinners, reflecting his profound sense of betrayal to humanity and to God.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>These characters, and many others, serve as both personal encounters for Dante and symbolic figures representing various sins. Each interaction with these figures serves to deepen the reader’s understanding of the moral lessons Dante wishes to impart.</p>
